    "<h2 id=\"rand_samp\">Types of Random Sampling</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In <b id=\"simple_rand\">simple random sampling</b>, each element of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Requirements include that the population be finite, and each element exclusive and indistinguishable. Simple random sampling is highly accepted, requires minimal prior knowledge of a population, and is essentially free from subjectivity; but it can very well require the highest level of expense and expertise in subject matter.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If done without replacement, which is more common, each element in the sampling frame may be selected only once. If done with replacement, each entity may be selected twice or more, as the pool of individuals from which they are sampled has each individual replaced upon selection.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In <b id=\"syst_samp\">systematic sampling</b>, a researcher divides the population by sample size, then chooses a number between one and the population size to be the first in the sample, and also selects every X<sup>th</sup> item after the first. Systematic random sampling, in which the population is first sorted randomly, is generally preferable, as there may otherwise be order bias, an unwanted sorting of the data along some metric. Repeated systematic sampling is a variant which seeks to avoid the possibility of systemic biases due to periodicity in the sampling frame.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b id=\"strat_rand\">Stratified random sampling</b> utilizes ‘strata’, meaning variables (e.g., age) grouped in sampling. One may simultaneously stratify for multiple variables, and the finer the stratification, the more precision per stratum, compared to simple random sampling. One may stratify for multiple variables simultaneously. A primary sampling unit (PSA) is the level of aggregation immediately above the individual level, such as residences compared to individuals in a census.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Advantages of stratified sampling include a lack of subjectivity, and a tendency to be well-representative. Disadvantages include the need to determine criteria by which to separate, a focus toward one or few features, the risk in generalizing by strata, and the time and expense of randomization.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In <b id=\"clust_samp\">cluster sampling</b>, the researcher creates samples of individuals with certain aggregational units of interest (e.g., ethnicity). Single-stage cluster sampling is synonymous with stratified random sampling. Multi-stage cluster sampling is synonymous with multi-stage stratified sampling, and called ‘area-sampling’ in geographic contexts. Some reserve the term cluster-sampling for two-stage multi-cluster sampling, and multi-stage cluster sampling for purposes of 3 or more stages.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In <b id=\"multi_stg\">multi-stage stratified random sampling</b>, the researcher draws simple random samples from successively more homogenous groups (strata) until the individual subject level is reached. For example, stratifying by industry, and then sampling companies by industry at random, and perhaps then people by company at random. It increases research precision by ensuring that key populations of subjects are represented in the sample.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The greater the heterogeneity of the strata, and the finer the stratification, the greater the precision of results. It becomes more precise with each stratification because the variance of individuals from each strata is less than the population variance (standard errors are reduced).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When stratification reduces standard error, multistage sampling increases it, because the chances of sampling error accumulate at each stage. Multi-stage or cluster sampling is usually less precise than simple random, which in turn is less precise than one-stage stratified sampling.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Disproportionate stratified sampling occurs when disproportionate numbers exist for some strata vs. others. One use is to oversample criteria populations (e.g., members of a particular ethnicity) to allow statistical analysis of adequate precision. The problems inherent to unbalanced sampling by strata do apply.</p>"

Chain referral sampling, a.k.a. network sampling, is a method of selecting experts whereby the researcher starts with a subject displaying the qualities of interest, and then uses their referral to find others, and so forth.</p>\n"
